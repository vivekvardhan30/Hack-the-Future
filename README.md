# Hack-the-Future
<h1>Sustainable Agriculture through Multi-Agent Al Collaboration</h1><br>
<p>We propose a multi-agent Al system built using Python and SQLite that brings
together diverse stakeholders—farmers, market analysts, weather data, and
environmental experts—into a unified decision-making platform. The system will
empower farmers to make smart, sustainable, and profitable choices about what
crops to grow and when to grow them.</p>
